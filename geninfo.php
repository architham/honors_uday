        <h1>UNM Honors College General Information</h1>
<p>
  The Honors College provides the opportunity for high achieving students to develop a broad-based and flexible interdisciplinary liberal arts education similar to that of many small liberal arts colleges.

The B.A. in Honors Interdisciplinary Liberal Arts will provide students with a foundation in social and behavioral studies, physical and natural sciences, humanities, communications, mathematics, and fine arts and allow students to focus on a specific area of interdisciplinary study.</p>
