<h3>Priority Registration</h3>
<p>Priority Registration is one of the unique benefits granted to Honors 
students. The <a href="http://registrar.unm.edu/">UNM Registrars' Office</a> 
determines the dates when all students attending the university can sign up for 
classes. Generally, transfer students register first, followed by graduate 
students, then seniors, juniors, sophomores and finally freshmen. The grade 
levels are determined by accumulated credit hours at the University. With 
Priority Registration, Honors students can register on the same day as graduate 
students. Essentially, Honors students can get a "first-pick" of courses and 
thereby coordinate their busy school, work, and family schedules. </p>
<p><strong>Spring 2013 Priority Registration starts on Monday, </strong>November 
26th, 2012 at 12.01 a.m.</p>

<h3>Departmental Permission</h3>
<p>Honors students must obtain "departmental permission" to add an Honors course 
to their schedule. The Honors office can grant permission to students who have 
filled out an Override Card and are in good standing with the Honors College.
